Task: Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework

.NET is an umbrella term which comprises of FCL (Framework Class Library) and many languages(C#, VB.NET, C++/CLI, F#, ...),  which compiles source code and outputs IL (Intermediate Language). 
IL will be consumed by CLR (Common Language Runtime) and converts it into platform specific code during runtime by the JIT (just-in-time) compiler.
.NET is a common type system, set of libraries, run time and over all environment under which compliant code is executed.

C# is a programming language using which you can develop software utilizing the FCL and can target many platforms (Windows, Linux - using Mono, iOS - using Xamarin, ...).
C# is one of the languages whose compiler generates .net compliant code that can run on framework.
