# Homework: Arrays

# 01. Allocate array

## Description
Write a program that allocates array of **N** integers, initializes each element by its index multiplied by `5` and the prints the obtained array on the console.

## Input
- On the only line you will receive the number **N**

## Output
- Print the obtained array on the console.
  - Each number should be on a new line

---

# 02. Lexicographically compare
Write a program that compares two `char` arrays lexicographically (letter by letter).

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the first `char` array as a string
- On the second line you will receive the second `char` array as a string

## Output
- Print `<` if the first array is lexicographically smaller
- Print `>` if the second array is lexicographically smaller
- Print `=` if the arrays are equal

---

# 03. Maximal sequence

## Description
Write a program that finds the length of the **maximal sequence** of equal elements in an array of **N** integers.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the number **N**
- On the next **N** lines the numbers of the array will be given

## Output
- Print the length of the **maximal sequence**

---

# 04. Maximal increasing sequence

## Description
Write a program that finds the length of the **maximal increasing sequence** in an array of **N** integers.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the number **N**
- On the next **N** lines the numbers of the array will be given

## Output
- Print the length of the **maximal increasing sequence**

---

# 05. Selection sort

## Description
**Sorting** an array means to arrange its elements in increasing order. Write a program to sort an array.
Use the [Selection sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort) algorithm: Find the smallest element, move it at the first position, find the smallest from the rest, move it at the second position, etc.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the number **N**
- On the next **N** lines the numbers of the array will be given

## Output
- Print the sorted array
  - Each number should be on a new line

---

# 06. Frequent number

## Description
Write a program that finds the most frequent number in an array of **N** elements.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the number **N**
- On the next **N** lines the numbers of the array will be given

## Output
- Print the most frequent number and how many time it is repeated
  - Output should be `REPEATING_NUMBER (REPEATED_TIMES times)`

---

# 07. Binary search

## Description
Write a program that finds the index of given element **X** in a sorted array of **N** integers by using the [Binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) algorithm.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the number **N**
- On the next **N** lines the numbers of the array will be given
- On the last line you will receive the number **X**

## Output
- Print the index where **X** is in the array
  - If there is more than one occurence print the first one
  - If there are no occurences print `-1`

# 08. Subset with sum S

## Description
We are given an array of integers and a number `S`.
Write a program to find if there exists a subset of the elements of the array that has a sum `S`.

## Sample tests

|       input array                      | S  |     result    |
|:--------------------------------------:|:--:|:-------------:|
| 2, **1**, **2**, 4, 3, **5**, 2, **6** | 14 | yes           |

---

# 09. Permutations of set

## Description
Write a program that reads a number `N` and generates and prints all the permutations of the numbers [`1 â€¦ N`].

## Sample tests

| N |                                  result                                 |
|:-:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| 3 | `{1, 2, 3}` <br> `{1, 3, 2}` <br> `{2, 1, 3}` <br> `{2, 3, 1}` <br> `{3, 1, 2}` <br> `{3, 2, 1}` |

# 10. Prime numbers

## Description
Write a program that finds all prime numbers in the range [`1 ... N`]. Use the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes) algorithm. The program should print the biggest prime number which is `<= N`.

## Input
- On the first line you will receive the number **N**

## Output
- Print the biggest prime number which is `<= N`

---

# 11. Find sum in array

## Description
Write a program that finds in given array of integers a sequence of given sum `S` (if present).

## Sample tests

|        array            |  S |  result |
|-------------------------|----|---------|
| 4, 3, 1, **4, 2, 5**, 8 | 11 | 4, 2, 5 |
