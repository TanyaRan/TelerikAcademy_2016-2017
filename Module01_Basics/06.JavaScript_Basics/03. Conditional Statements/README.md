# Homework: Conditional statements

# 01. Exchange if greater

## Description
Write an `if` statement that takes two double variables `a` and `b` and exchanges their values if the first one is greater than the second.
As a result print the values `a` and `b`, separated by a space.

## Input
- The input will consist of an array containing two values - `a` and `b` represented as strings

## Output
- The output should be a single line containing two numbers

## Constraints
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

# 02. Multiplication Sign

## Description
Write a script that shows the sign (`+`, `-` or `0`) of the product of three real numbers, without calculating it.
Use a sequence of `if` operators.

## Input
- The input will consist of an array containing three values - `a`, `b` and `c` represented as strings

## Output
- The output should be a single line containing `+`, `-` or `0`

## Constraints
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

# 03. The biggest of Three

## Description
Write a script that finds the biggest of three numbers.
Use nested `if` statements.

## Input
- The input will consist of an array containing three values represented as strings

## Output
- The output should be a single line containing a number

## Constraints
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

# 04. Sort 3 numbers

## Description
Sort 3 real values in descending order.
Use nested `if` statements.

_Note: Don’t use arrays and the built-in sorting functionality._

## Input
- The input will consist of an array containing three values represented as strings

## Output
- The output should be a single line containing three numbers separated by spaces

## Constraints
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

# 05. Digit as word

## Description
Write a script that asks for a digit `(0-9)`, and depending on the input, shows the digit as a word (in English).
Print `not a digit` in case of invalid input.
Use a `switch` statement.

## Input
- The input will consist of an array containing a single string

## Output
- The output should be a single line

## Constraints
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

# 06. Quadratic equation

## Description
Write a script that reads the coefficients `a`, `b` and `c` of a quadratic equation <code>ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0</code> and solves it (prints its real roots).
Calculates and prints its real roots.

_Note: Quadratic equations may have 0, 1 or 2 real roots._

## Input
- The input will consist of an array containing three values - `a`, `b` and `c` represented as strings

## Output
- The output should be a single line containing the real roots (see sample tests)
  - Print numbers with **two digits of precision** after the floating point
  - If there are two roots then `x1 < x2`

## Constraints
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

# 07. The biggest of five numbers

## Description
Write a script that finds the biggest of given 5 variables.
Use nested `if` statements.

## Input
- The input will consist of an array containing five values represented as strings

## Output
- The output should be a single line containing the answer

## Constraints
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**

# 08. Number as words

## Description
Write a script that converts a number in the range `[0…999]` to words, corresponding to its English pronunciation.

## Input
- The input will consist of an array containing the number as a string

## Output
- The output should be a single line containing the answer

## Constraints
- Time limit: **0.2s**
- Memory limit: **16MB**
